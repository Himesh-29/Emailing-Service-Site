# Emailing-Service-Site

This is the a basic website implementing the stuff for emailing from one person to another having Gmail Accounts safely and securely. It's frontend is made from <b>ReactJS</b> and backend is made using <b>Node and Express</b>

In this project, I have used <a href="https://nodemailer.com/about/"><b>Nodemailer</b></a> to implement the emailing service from one gmail account to another.

All you need to run this project in your localhost, just clone the repository and in the base folder, just open CMD and type the following: 
<code>npm run both</code>

### Note: For emailing from one client to another, your gmail account should allow the access to less secure apps
